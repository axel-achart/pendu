# 🎮 Pendu Game

**Pendu** is a classic **word-guessing game** developed using **Python** and **Pygame**.  
Players try to discover a hidden word by guessing letters within a limited number of attempts. For each wrong guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn, staying true to the traditional Hangman rules. The game tracks player scores and maintains a leaderboard saved in a score file.
